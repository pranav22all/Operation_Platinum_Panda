		<h4 class="cent_text"> The Cheng Foundation is run by both <strong>Bryce</strong> and <strong>Darrell</strong> Cheng, the foundation presidents. Brief descriptions of each co-president are available below.</h4>

				<p>At an early age, Bryce Cheng was tasked with the heavy burden of upholding the prestigious
				Cheng Family Legacy. As the oldest of the "twin dragons,"" Bryce was tasked with "making the Cheng
				Family great again" in the then foreign continent of North America. Alongside his younger brother,
				Darrell, Bryce underwent integrated training in University of Washington Academy for Young Scholars to
				acquire the skills that are necessary to survive in the brutal and capitalist world of the United States.</p>
				<p class = "cent_text big_print"><strong>Rice to Greatness</strong></p> 
				<p>After receiving a "miniscule" loan of two-million dollars from their family fortune,

				Bryce established a strong foothold in the American economy by investing in construction through his

				newfound company, The Cheng Organization. Through said company, Bryce monopolized the market

				for construction and property development (twice running Donald Trump Bankrupt). In addition, Bryce

				was able to curb the inevitable downsizing through lobbying and bribery of the U.S. government with his

				now 30-billion dollar net worth.</p>
				<p class = "cent_text big_print"><strong>Enlightenment and Future Investment in Philanthropy</strong></p>
				<p>After monopolizing the construction market

				through aggressive negotiations and heartless actions, Bryce Cheng was now a leading figure in

				American Business earning himself a position in the Fortune 500. However, Cheng was haunted by the

				costs of his success in the construction market after witnessing the countless competitors that lay

				bankrupt in the wake of his rise. In order to cope with the burdensome guilt of witnessing the

				numerous failures that precipitated into his success, Bryce Cheng, with the help of Darrel Cheng (now

				CEO of Cheng Consolidated Entertainment Facilities), merged to found the Cheng Foundation.</p>

		    	<img class="img-responsive center-block" src = "images/Dar_Hori.jpg" alt="Darrell Cheng">
		 		<p class = "cent_text big_print"><strong>Childhood</strong></p> 
		  		<p>In his childhood, Darrell was constantly neglected by his parents due to being the younger

				child. This constant neglect during his development prompted Darrell to train intensively in order to one

				day surpass his brother, Bryce. As the other half of the "Twin Dragons," Darrell went to the University of

				Washington Academy for Young Scholars in order to gain the skills necessary to survive in the high-stakes business environment.</p>
				<p class = "cent_text big_print"><strong>Rice to Greatness</strong></p> 
				<p>After graduating from the University of Washing Academy for Young Scholars, Cheng

				established a strong foothold in the Entertainment Business by constructing a slew of high-end night

				clubs in government-designated brownfields, lands previously considered "lost" due to excessive human

				abuse. By doing so, Cheng won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for the effective reclamation of

				brownfields. In addition, Darrell was able to establish a monopoly in the entertainment business by

				suing other companies on behalf of contamination of the environment. As a result, the company,

				"Cheng Consolidated Entertainment Facilities" was born.</p>
				<p class = "cent_text big_print"><strong>Enlightenment and Future Investment in Philanthropy</strong></p>
				<p>At the epitome of his success, Cheng was described

				as an ignorant and inconsiderate playboy. However, this all changed when Darrell's yacht, the Verdant

				Legacy, capsized during a storm. Cheng later spent five months on the distant island of Lien Choy. Not

				much was known during his five month excursion, but Darrell proclaimed himself a changed man after

				he was rescued by Mongolian Fisherman. In order to atone for his past actions as a playboy leach of the

				Cheng Family, Darrell co-founded the Cheng foundation with his brother, Bryce.</p>
